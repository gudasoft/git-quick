# Quick Git

The fastest way to quickly commit or restore a file from vscode.

Provides those commands:

| Command          | Description                               |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `git-quick-commit` | Commit current file, prompt for message |
| `git-quick-restore` | Restores the current file               |
| `git-quick-checkout` | Alias for `git-quick-restore` command |

It won't activate if you are not using Git.

It won't nag you if the file is not changed.

It will save the file for you, and then prompt for a commit message.

If you have opened two git repositories, the extension will know to which one the file belongs.

No external dependencies - uses the vscode git extension.

## History

Do you know that Sublime has a "Quick Commit", "Quick Checkout" feature?

It was fast and you can commit in the middle of your work without getting out of the work context.

Enjoy the quick commit and restore and in the future more quick commands!
